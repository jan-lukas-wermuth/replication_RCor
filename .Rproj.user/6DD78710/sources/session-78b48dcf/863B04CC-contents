# Replication: "Proper Correlation Coefficients for Nominal Random Variables"

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains replication material for the paper "Proper Correlation Coefficients for Nominal Random Variables" by Jan-Lukas Wermuth. The corresponding ``R`` package is available in the repository [NCor](https://github.com/jan-lukas-wermuth/NCor).


## Installation and Data Availability

In order to run the replication code, please install the ``R`` package [NCor](https://github.com/jan-lukas-wermuth/NCor) first.

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("jan-lukas-wermuth/RCor")
install_github("jan-lukas-wermuth/NCor")
```

It may be necessary to install further packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). All the necessary packages are listed at the beginning of each ``R`` script.

The data used in the empirical application on countries and income is available in the [Luxembourg Income Study Database](https://www.lisdatacenter.org). It is impossible to download the data. Instead, every user has to create an account that allows to work with the data in [LISSY](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/), a remote-execution system in which ``R`` code can be run.

The data for the second empirical application on countries and religions can be downloaded from the [World Religion Database](https://www.worldreligiondatabase.org) (only with a subscription). After downloading, please save the file under the name "Religionsbycountryin2020.xlsx" in the folder "data".

## code
This folder contains the ``R``code that is needed to compute all the results in the paper. I give a short overview over the several scripts in the folder.

- True_gammas.R: This file simulates the values for $\gamma^*$ for each DGP that is described in the paper and a grid of dependence parameters $\alpha$.

- CIs_Coverage.R: This script simulates empirical coverage rates of the confidence intervals for $\gamma^*$ for the same DGPs as above.

- IndependenceTest.R: This file simulates size and power values for the independence test based on $\gamma^*$ and a traditional competitor described in the paper. It uses the same DGPs as above.

- Coverage_plots.R: Here, the plots corresponding to the results obtained from CIs_Coverage.R are produced.

- Pval_plots.R: Here, the plots corresponding to the results obtained from IndependenceTest.R are created.

- IncomeCountryExample.R: This script is meant to be run in LISSY, a remote-execution system provided by the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database (see the remark in the section on data availability). It produces the estimates for $\gamma^*$ as well as its confidence intervals for the empirical example concerning the dependence between the variables country and income.

- ReligionCountryExample.R: This file computes several correlation coefficients for a number of border triangles. It uses data from the [World Religion Database](https://www.worldreligiondatabase.org) (see the remark in the section on data availability).

- WorldMap.R: Here, the plots corresponding to the results obtained from IncomeCountryExample.R and ReligionCountryExample.R are produced.

## data
After downloading the dataset from the [World Religion Database](https://www.worldreligiondatabase.org), please store it in this folder (see the remark in the section on data availability).

## results
### Plots
This folder contains all plots.

### Simulations
This folder contains all the raw simulation results in three subfolders: Coverage, IndependenceTest and True_gammas.
